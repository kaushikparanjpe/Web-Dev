Dragon Prince...!
The war between MoonElves and Humans has come to an important point.
There is a prophecy about a Dragon Prince that was passed on by our ancestors.

You are the chosen one to complete this profecy and save Xadia from destruction!
Carry this dragon Egg to top of the Mountain Peak Dragon's Gate.

You will have to defeat the monstors on way to Dragon's gate and retain their powers!
Use these powers to defeat the demons on way to top!

In the end you will need to carry the egg to Dragon's gate and create Eye of thunder.
The Eye of thunder will make this egg hatch and a Dragon will be born who will save the earth from extinction.

The destiny of humanity lies in your hands!
Good Luck!!!
